# AI-Playground-A-Flask-Based-AI-Algorithms-Demonstartion
Hi, welcome to the AI Playground!

This project is a visual and interactive web-based GUI built using Flask, designed to demonstrate and explain the working of classic Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. 
Whether you're a student learning AI or just curious about how these algorithms work step-by-step, this playground is an intuitive and engaging way to explore them.

ðŸš€ Features
This web app includes interactive simulations for the following AI algorithms:

8-Puzzle Solver
Solve the classic 8-puzzle problem using BFS or A*, and see each move visualized step-by-step.

Water Jug Problem
Explore the constraint satisfaction problem with animated jug visuals and real-time solution tracking.

Water Jug using Hill Climbing
Understand local search with Hill Climbing. Shows when the algorithm reaches a local maximum.

Tic-Tac-Toe (Human vs AI / Human vs Human)
Play against an AI using basic heuristics, or against a friend in a best-of-3 match format.

Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Visualize BFS/DFS algorithms solving the TSP across a set of cities with animated path drawing.

Find-S Algorithm Trainer
Input custom training examples and attributes to see the most specific hypothesis learned.
